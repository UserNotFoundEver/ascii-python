ASCII ART ANIMATION GENERATOR
This project showcases a visually appealing ASCII art display that combines a typing animation with a dynamic rainbow color effect. The application renders ASCII art in the browser, simulating a typewriter-like animation where each character is typed out sequentially, enhanced by a vibrant array of colors that cycle through the spectrum of the rainbow.

Features
Dynamic Typing Animation: Characters are displayed one at a time to mimic the effect of typing, creating an engaging visual experience.
Rainbow Color Effect: Each character cycles through a predefined set of colors (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet), giving the ASCII art a colorful and dynamic appearance.
Customizable Speed: The speed of the typing animation is adjustable, allowing for faster or slower displays based on preference.
Responsive Design: Compatible with various display sizes, ensuring the ASCII art maintains its integrity and visual appeal across devices.
How It Works
The animation is implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:

HTML provides the structure, hosting the ASCII art within a <pre> tag to preserve formatting.
CSS styles the container and text, adding aesthetic customization options like background color and text padding.
JavaScript dynamically adds each character of the ASCII art into the HTML document, applying a color from the rainbow sequence and controlling the timing of each character's appearance.

Coming soon:
Ability to import your own images and convert to ascii art and export in different file formats + more

Code is provided as is.
